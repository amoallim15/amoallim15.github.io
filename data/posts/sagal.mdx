🚀 I’ve been working on something close to my heart for the past few months, and I’m thrilled to share a glimpse of it with you all. 
This project is called Sagal, a new programming language that reflects my ongoing exploration of language design and the deep patterns that shape how we express ideas in code.

📚 In my previous article, [*The Grammar of Code: A Framework Inspired by Linguistics*](https://open.substack.com/pub/amoallim/p/the-grammar-of-code-a-framework-inspired?utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web), I touched on the roots of this project—drawing inspiration from natural languages to craft a more expressive, human-centered approach to programming. **Sagal** embodies that vision.

✨ This is just the beginning. Sagal is evolving, and I’m excited to see where it leads. 
Your feedback, ideas, and thoughts would be invaluable as I continue to shape this language. 
Let me know what resonates with you, what doesn’t, and where you think this could go.
